        <h2> Twice Baked Loaded Breakfast Potatoes Recipe </h2>
        <h3> Ingridents </h3>
         </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon avocado oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper (for roasting)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup whole milk, hot</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt (for mashed potatoes), more to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper (for mashed potatoes)</li>
            <li>6 slices beef bacon, each cut in half</li>
            <li>¾ cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li> 
            <li>salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Instructions </h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Bake the Potatoes
                <p>
                Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Scrub 
                the russet potatoes clean, then use a fork to poke holes all 
                around each potato to allow for even roasting. Rub them with 
                avocado oil, salt, and black pepper. Place them directly on the 
                oven rack and bake for about 50–60 minutes, or until 
                fork-tender. Let them cool slightly.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li>Prepare the Filling
                <p>
                Slice each potato in half lengthwise and 
                scoop out most of the inside, leaving a sturdy shell. In a 
                bowl, mash the scooped potatoes with butter, hot milk, salt, 
                and black pepper until smooth.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Assemble
                <p>
                Spoon most of the mashed potatoes back into the 
                shells, pressing down in the center to create a well. Place two 
                halved slices of beef bacon in each well, sprinkle with 
                shredded cheddar, and carefully crack an egg on top. Sprinkle 
                with salt and pepper.
                </p>
                 <li>Bake Again
                    <p>
                    Return the stuffed potatoes to the oven and bake at 350°F 
                    (190°C) for 15–20 minutes, or until the egg whites are set 
                    but the yolks are still slightly runny.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Serve & Enjoy
                <p>
                Let them cool for a couple of minutes, then dig 
                in and enjoy this perfect breakfast bite!
